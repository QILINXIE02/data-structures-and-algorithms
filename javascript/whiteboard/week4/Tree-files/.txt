Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have two file structures (directory trees).
Each file directory can have at most 2 files or folders.
We need to compare these two directory structures and determine whether they have the same number of individual files.

Domain-Specific Words & Phrases:

File Directory Structure: A tree-like structure where folders contain other folders or files.
File: A unit of storage that holds data.
Folder (Directory): A container that holds other files and folders.
Sub-element: A child element within a folder (either another folder or a file).


Imagine you have two folders with files inside them.
Each folder can have at most 2 files or other folders.
We want to compare these two folders and see if they have the same number of individual files.
If they do, we say “true.” If not, we say “false.”
Example:

Folder 1 has 4 files.
Folder 2 has 3 files.
Since they don’t have the same number of files, it’s “false.”
That’s it! We’re just counting files in folders.




Step 2: Identify Test Cases

Let’s create some test cases:

Sample Test Case (True):
Both trees contain 5 files.
Ex:
Tree 1:
├── File A
├── Folder X
│   └── File B
└── Folder Y
    └── File C

Tree 2:
├── File D
├── Folder P
│   └── File E
└── Folder Q
    └── File F

Empty Directories: Two directories with no files or folders. Expected output: True (both have 0 files).
Directories with Folders Only: Two directories, each with one or two empty folders. Expected output: True (file count is 0 in both).
Matching File Structure with Different Names: Two directories with different folder names but the same number of files spread across those folders. Expected output: True (same file count).
Unequal File Count: Two directories with a different number of files within their structures. Expected output: False (unequal file count).

Step 4: Plan the Algorithm
We’ll count the number of individual files in each tree and compare the counts.


Step 6: Verify
Visually step through the code with the sample test cases to verify correctness.
Big O analysis:
Time complexity: O(N) (where N is the total number of files and folders in both trees)
Space complexity: O(H) (where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack)
