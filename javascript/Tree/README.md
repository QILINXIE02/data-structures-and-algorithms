# Code Challenge Tree: Class 15
Implement a set of classes for working with trees, including a Node class, a Binary Tree class, and a Binary Search Tree class. These classes should allow for the creation and manipulation of binary trees, as well as common tree traversal methods.

## Approach
The approach involves implementing classes for working with trees, including a Node class, a Binary Tree class, and a Binary Search Tree class. Each class has specific methods for creating, manipulating, and traversing trees.

### Big O
- Time Complexity: O(n) - The time complexity for tree traversal methods is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- Space Complexity: O(1) - The space complexity is O(1) for individual operations within the methods.
